# Final Project

## Objective
We have learned how to use HTML, CSS, SASS and JavaScript to create websites that
are beautiful, responsive and dynamic. In this final task, our goal is to put these skills into use to create a website that we can show as part of our portfolio.


For a developer, a personal portfolio plays an important role to showcase his/her works, reach to potential clients or land a job.
